This combination of two simple games that can be easily run in console/terminal
is the end result of the first 3 projects from our training course. At first we
simply have to make a text based game that accepts user input in order to make
a basic decision. That would be the dragon's cave. The second project was to
create a simple guessing game where the machine chooses a random number and the
player has 6 guesses as to what the number is. The third and final project in
this set was to add unit testing, as such I made use of the JUnit framework to
implement this.
