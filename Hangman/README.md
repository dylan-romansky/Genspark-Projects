This simple game is a recreation of everyone's favourite word
guessing game played with stick figures and dashed lines,
Hangman. The task is simple enough, create a game that chooses
a random word, make the player guess the word using console
input, and of course track a gamestate. I chose to take this
just a small step further by querying a website using Selenium
in order to get the word just so I could say I did. This game
is played entirely in terminal.
