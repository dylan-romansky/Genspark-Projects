This is an extremely simple grid-based rpg with turn-based mechanics. In its current state it's playable, but must be relaunched every time you run out of health.

Arrow keys or wasd let you move around and navigate menus. Enter makes your selection. I am currently implementing Escape as the back key

Todolist: add a proper death screen, add an out-of-combat inventory menu, add text for events during combat
