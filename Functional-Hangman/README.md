Similar to the Hangman project, Functional hangman tasks you
with creating a version of the classic word guessing game,
but this time it must be done with functional programming,
with only a single while loop to serve as the main game loop.
all other "loops" must be handled using the Java Stream
methods map, filter, and reduce. Further, art for this game
is to be read from a file, the user is to be able to input
their name, and the game is to track the high scores and
display for the current user whether or not they have the
high score.
